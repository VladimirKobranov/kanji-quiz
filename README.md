Here, you can practice with N5 to N1 `Kanji` levels, along with their `meanings` and `On'yomi`[^1] and `Kun'yomi`[^1] readings.

A blue card indicates a correct answer, while a red card indicates an incorrect one.
After you're done, press the `Results` button to see your accuracy percentage.

Press the `Reset` button to start over.

### Good luck! :heart:

### 頑張って!


[^1]: To use on'yomi and kun'yomi(or on-reading and kun-reading) you need a Japanese layout in your system.
